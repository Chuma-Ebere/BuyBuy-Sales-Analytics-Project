# BuyBuy-Sales-Analytics-Project
BuyBuy is an e-commerce platform that offers a wide range of products to their loyal customers. As a Data Analyst on the BuyBuy team, I am tasked with completing and submitting a sales analysis report to help inform the management’s decision on the next phase of plans to improve the company’s product offerings to their customers.
The task was completed using SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for the visualisation and presentation of KPI’s. Also, a final report was attached summarizing the insights gained from my analysis.
